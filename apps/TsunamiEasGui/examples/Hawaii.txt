 RECORDED AT HILO AND KAHULUI JUST ABOVE ADVISORY LEVEL THAT COULD
 BE A HAZARD TO SWIMMERS AND BOATERS AS WELL AS TO PERSONS NEAR
 THE SHORE AT BEACHES AND IN HARBORS AND MARINAS.  THE THREAT MAY
 CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL HOURS AFTER THE INITIAL WAVE ARRIVAL.

 THE ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL OF THE INITIAL WAVE IS

FURTHER MESSAGES WILL BE ISSUED HOURLY OR SOONER AS CONDITIONS
